In this project we provide both the database and the code with the different methods. In this project we apply different commercial and improved ML models for the diagnosis of breast cancer using different parameters extracted from the study patients, separated between healthy and diseased. The different methods can be launched from the main called "work", which employs both supervised and unsupervised methods.
