In this project we will present the coding of the final master project: Dual Bayesian Linear Regression for the characterization of schizophrenia.

The goal of this project is to detect relevant areas of magnetic resonance images in order to extract biomarkers from them. For this process, the images will be processed by a system based on Bayesian inference systems designed by our own research group.

The images used during the study, as well as the procedures of parameter adjustment and model explanation will not be published in this repository until the final issue of the article in a scientific journal that can give us validity. The images, however, due to the different ethical and privacy procedures will never be published, have been used images of laboratory rat brain.
